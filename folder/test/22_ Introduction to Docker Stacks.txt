Docker Swarm's orchestration functionality really shines when using stacks. Stacks allow you to easily manage complex, multi-container applications and orchestrate them within your swarm cluster. In this lesson, we will discuss Docker stacks. We will demonstrate how to create and manage Docker stacks, as well as a few of the available options for designing stacks.

Lesson Reference:-
Create a compose file for the stack.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo Hello!; sleep 10; done"


Deploy the stack and examine it using various commands.
docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple
docker stack ls
docker stack ps simple
docker stack services simple
docker service logs simple_busybox


Modify the stack to use an environment variable.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo $$MESSAGE; sleep 10; done"
     environment:
     - MESSAGE=Hello!
 docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple
 docker service logs simple_busybox


Modify the stack to expose a port.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
     ports:
     - "8080:80"
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo $$MESSAGE; sleep 10; done"
     environment:
     - MESSAGE=Hello!
 docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple
 curl localhost:8080


Modify the stack to use the BusyBox service to communicate with the web service.

 vi simple-stack.yml
 version: '3'
 services:
   web:
     image: nginx
     ports:
     - "8080:80"
   busybox:
     image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
     command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo $$MESSAGE; curl web:80; sleep 10; done"
     environment:
     - MESSAGE=Hello!


docker stack deploy -c simple-stack.yml simple


Delete the stack.
docker stack rm simple
