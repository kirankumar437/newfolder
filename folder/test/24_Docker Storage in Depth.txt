Storage is essential to almost any system, and containers are no exception. In this lesson, we will go into a little more detail about some of the storage driver concepts that we discussed earlier. We will go over the three most common storage drivers and discuss which operating systems they belong to. We will also discuss storage methods and how to locate the underlying data for containers and images on the host file system.

Lesson Reference:-

Run a basic container:
docker run --name storage_nginx nginx

Use docker inspect to find the location of the container's data on the host:
docker container inspect storage_nginx

ls /var/lib/docker/overlay2/<STORAGE_HASH>/

Use docker inspect to find the location of an image's data:
docker image inspect nginx
