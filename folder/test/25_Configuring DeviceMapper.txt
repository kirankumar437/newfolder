We have already discussed some of the storage drivers that are available with Docker, but in this lesson we will focus specifically on the DeviceMapper storage driver. We will configure DeviceMapper to use direct-lvm mode to manage storage on a block storage device, which is recommended when using DeviceMapper in production.

Relevant Documentation:-
https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/

Lesson Reference:-
For this lesson, use a CentOS 7 server with a size of Small. Before starting the lesson, you'll first need to install Docker.

Add a new storage device to your server. In Playground, select Actions, then select Add /dev/xvdb and wait for it to finish adding the device.

Stop and disable Docker.
sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl stop docker


Delete any existing Docker data.
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker


Configure DeviceMapper in daemon.json.

 sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json

 {
   "storage-driver": "devicemapper",
   "storage-opts": [
     "dm.directlvm_device=/dev/nvme1n1",
     "dm.thinp_percent=95",
     "dm.thinp_metapercent=1",
     "dm.thinp_autoextend_threshold=80",
     "dm.thinp_autoextend_percent=20",
     "dm.directlvm_device_force=true"
   ]
 }


Start and enable Docker.
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker


Check the storage driver information provided by docker info.
docker info

Run a container to verify that everything is working.
docker run hello-world
