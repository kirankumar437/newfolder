Overlay networks provide transparent network connectivity to containers running in a Swarm, regardless of whether they are running on the same or different nodes. In this lesson, we will discuss overlay networks and demonstrate how to use them to connect containers in a Docker Swarm.

Lesson Reference
List the networks on the host. You should be able to see the default ingress overlay network.

 docker network ls


Create an attachable overlay network.

 docker network create --driver overlay --attachable my-overlay


Create a service that uses that network, then test the network by attaching a container to it and using the container to communicate with the service.

 docker service create --name overlay-service --network my-overlay --replicas 3 nginx
 docker run --rm --network my-overlay radial/busyboxplus:curl curl overlay-service:80
